 CiGri is a lightweight grid middle-ware designed to run on top of a set of OAR (http://oar.imag.fr) clusters to manage efficiently large sets of multi-parametric tasks (also called bag-of-tasks).

With a powerful events handling, it manages automatic re-submission that is useful for best-effort jobs. With OAR and CIGRI, it is easy to reach 100% of usage efficiency on an heterogeneous grid in a local HPC center.

CiGri v3 is written in Ruby by CIMENT, the MESCAL team (from the LIG laboratory) and INRIA. It is released as a free software under the GPL.

## Main features

- Big job campaigns management (> 100000)
- OAR best-effort jobs management (automatic re-submission)
- Submission with a JSON description file and optional parameters file
- Users/Clusters affinity (prioritizing users on some clusters)
- Smart events management (events aggregation, stderr pull, blacklistingâ€¦)
- Admission rules
- Test mode
- Smart queue load management (adaptative runners)
- OAR array jobs submission (reduced submission overhead)
- Cluster stress detection
- RESTful API based communications with OAR
- RESTful API provided for client apps
- Full control of campaigns from CLI
- Per cluster campaign prologue/epilogue jobs
- Customizable users notifications (Mail or Jabber)
- Grid usage stats
- Per cluster/campaign limit of the number of jobs
- Heavy trace system (database)
- Tasks/clusters affinity

TODO:
- Scratches cleaner job
- Production Tasks/clusters affinity (currently beta)
- Production Smart temporal or dimensional grouping (currently beta)
- Web portal

Submission:

```
gridsub -f file.jdl
```
